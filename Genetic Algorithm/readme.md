- Purpose: This class was modified for the GeneticAlgorithmExample.java class
-          that was used for the Genetic Algorithm Assignment in CMSC 427
-          course at UMGC.  The Tournament Selection method was adapted from
-          The pseudocode in "Essential Metaheuristics" by Sean Luke, 2016,
-          pg. 45.
-          This Genetic algorithm estimates the omptimal water system size
-          for a Diamondback Terrapin.  You have the choice of to selection
-          types - Roulette style or Tournament sytle.
