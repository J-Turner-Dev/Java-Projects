## Java Traffic Simulator using Threads

This java program was a study using threads to stimulate multiple cars, traffic lights, and the position of each and displays if it is moving or stopped at a light. A thread pool scheduled executor was used to perform multiple tasks incrementally. The timer and the clock also used threads. The simulation runs with out a problem even when many cars and traffic lights are simulated.
